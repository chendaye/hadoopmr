There is S in one of the scenes When countless enemy soldiers came in
suddenly the unarmed people began to collapse in the vast square I was a man
and ran away with the only soldier under my team Hiding in the country The
atmosphere is extremely depressing and all the people dare not light up the
lights at home In the vast dark night if a household is lit it will lead to murder
The courtyard where I was hiding was brightly lit The hostess was swinging calmly I
need to explain to her who I am Another swing is shaking in the wind
